It's based around an STM32F405 microcontroller and runs on the [WhateverDSP framework](https://github.com/NuclearLighthouseStudios/WhateverDSP), offering low latency audio processing and fully class complicant USB audio and MIDI support.

FXDSP has interchangeable user interface PCBs so it can easily be tailored to the needs of each effect produced on the platform.

For more information and examples, please see the [WhateverDSP repository](https://github.com/NuclearLighthouseStudios/WhateverDSP).
